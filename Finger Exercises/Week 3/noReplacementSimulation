You have a bucket with 3 red balls and 3 green balls. Assume that once you draw a ball out of the bucket, you don't replace it. What is the probability of drawing 3 balls of the 
same color?

Write a Monte Carlo simulation to solve the above problem. Feel free to write a helper function if you wish.
